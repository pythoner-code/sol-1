# sol-1

## Functionality Overview

This README provides instructions for implementing three functionalities within your application:

1. **Creating a New Solana Account**
2. **Connecting to Phantom Wallet**
3. **Transferring SOL to a New Wallet**

Follow the steps outlined below to integrate these functionalities into your application.

### 1. Creating a New Solana Account

Implement a button titled "Create a new Solana account" that performs the following tasks:

- Generates a new KeyPair at the backend.
- Airdrops 2 SOL to the newly created Keypair.

### 2. Connecting to Phantom Wallet

Once the "Create a new Solana account" functionality is completed, implement a button titled "Connect to Phantom Wallet" that connects to the Phantom Wallet if it exists. This step involves integrating with the Phantom Wallet API or SDK to establish the connection.

### 3. Transferring SOL to a New Wallet

After successfully connecting to the Phantom Wallet, create a button titled "Transfer SOL to New Wallet" that initiates the following action:

- Triggers a transfer of 1 SOL (previously airdropped into the account generated in step 1) to the account connected in step 2.

## Implementation Steps

Follow these steps to implement the functionalities described above:

1. **Backend Implementation**:
   - Implement backend logic to generate a new KeyPair and perform SOL airdrop.
   - Ensure proper error handling and validation.

2. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Design and integrate buttons for each functionality in your frontend UI.
   - Implement frontend logic to trigger corresponding backend actions upon button clicks.
   - Provide user feedback and error messages as needed.

3. **Integration with Phantom Wallet**:
   - Integrate with the Phantom Wallet API or SDK to enable connection to the wallet.
   - Handle authentication and authorization securely.
   - Ensure compatibility with various browser environments.

4. **Transaction Handling**:
   - Implement transaction logic for transferring SOL between accounts.
   - Handle transaction signing and confirmation prompts securely.
   - Monitor transaction status and provide appropriate feedback to the user.

## Additional Considerations

- **Security**: Implement secure practices for key generation, wallet connection, and transaction handling.
- **User Experience**: Ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience with clear instructions and feedback.
- **Testing**: Thoroughly test each functionality to identify and resolve any bugs or issues.
- **Documentation**: Document your codebase, including function descriptions, parameters, and usage examples, to facilitate maintenance and collaboration.

For more detailed implementation guidelines and API references, refer to the official documentation of Solana, Phantom Wallet, and any other relevant libraries or frameworks used in your application.
